Apache TomEE 10.1.0 has been released

We are excited to announce the release of Apache TomEE 10.1.0!

This release includes an update to MicroProfile 6.1. In addition, we fixed some issues included the latest versions of our dependencies including some CVE fixes (like in Tomcat, Geronimo Mail or Smallrye).

We extend our deepest gratitude to everyone who contributed to this release, especially our incredible volunteers
who worked on TomEE 10 and on fixes in our upstream dependencies such as Tomcat, OWB, CXF, MyFaces, and more.

Your efforts made TomEE 10 possible!
