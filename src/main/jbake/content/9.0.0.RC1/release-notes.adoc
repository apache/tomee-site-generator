Apache TomEE 9.0.0.RC1 has been released.

This milestone gets us closer to a final 9.0.0 release. The milestone 8 was the first migration from javax to jakarta
namespace straight in the source code. The release was not production ready and the build was not stable, but the goal
was to get a base we could build upon.

The journey has been long, after working to stabilize the build and achieve a significant TCK coverage for Jakarta EE 9.1,
we decided to focus on supporting MicroProfile 5.0. We were still stuck on a very old version. The work we started on
Milestone 8 to migrate to SmallRye is now complete and we are pleased to announced we reached 100% of MicroProfile 5.0.

[NOTE]
The MicroProfile JWT implementation is entirely ours and has some great additions such as Bean Validation integration to
validate JWT tokens. The REST Client comes from Apache CXF implementation.

In terms of Jakarta EE 9.1 TCK, we are 12 failures short, but we are actively working on them so we can have a final release soon.

In addition to the previous work, we fixed a couple of bugs and did some dependency upgrades.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to this release, including all of our users and the people who submitted bug reports,
contributed code or documentation enhancements.
