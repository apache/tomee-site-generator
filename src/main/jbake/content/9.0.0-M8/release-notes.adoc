= Apache TomEE 9.0.0-M8 Release Notes
:index-group: Release Notes

:jbake-status: published

Apache TomEE 9.0.0-M8 has been released.

This milestone release differs from previous 9.x releases in the sense that
we migrated all TomEE code to the new Jakarta namespace.  Previously, we used bytecode relocation but most
of the integration code such as test support, arquillian, maven plugins were broken .

We are still working on some regressions and fixes in order to pass **all** TCK tests
for Jakarta EE 9.1 (again). However, our own tests and most of the TCK tests are green.

We are confident that this milestone can be used to gather feedback that will help stabilize TomEE 9.x before a final version is released.

It contains some bug fixes, (build related) enhancements and a lot of dependency upgrades as well as an upgrade of microprofile.
Note that we switched from Geronimo microprofile implementations to Smallrye for various reasons discussed on the mailing list.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to this release, including all of our users and the people who submitted bug reports, contributed code or documentation enhancements.
