=== JMS



The *Java Message Service* (JMS) API is a Java Message Oriented Middleware for creating, sending, receiving messages between two or more clients. The major benefits of JMS are:

* Communication between components loosely coupled.
* Asynchronous messages. Clients donâ€™t need to request messages in order to read them.
* Reliable messages. Each message is delivered once.


=== Glossary


* *JMS Provider*: The implementation of Message Oriented Middleware following JMS interfaces.
* *JMS Client*:  Application that produces or/and receives messages.
* *JMS Producer*: JMS client that creates and sends messages.
* *JMS Consumer*: JMS client that receives messages.
* *JMS Message*: The object that is transferred between clients.
* *JMS Queue*: Area that contains sent messages that are waiting to be read by only one consumer.
* *JMS Topic*: A distribution mechanism for publishing messages that are delivered to multiple subscribers.

=== JMS and TomEE

Apache TomEE (Plume and Plus) provide Apache ActiveMQ (http://activemq.apache.org/) as part of the distribution,
 and this can run in either embedded mode, or TomEE can connect to an external standalone ActiveMQ broker.
  Apache TomEE does allow ActiveMQ to be replaced by another JMS provider, or alternatively you can run two or more
  JMS providers simultaneously and specify which provider MDBs and callers should use via configuration.
