:jbake-status: published

The Apache TomEE team announces that support for Apache TomEE 8.0.x will end on 31 December 2023.

This means that after 31 December 2023:

- releases from the `tomee-8.x` branch are highly unlikely
- bugs affecting only the `tomee-8.x` branch will not be addressed
- security vulnerability reports will not be checked against the `tomee-8.x` branch
