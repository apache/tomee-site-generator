Apache TomEE 9.0.0 has been released.

We are very proud to release Apache TomEE 9.0.0 It's been
almost a year since we certified TomEE using a bytecode enhancement
approach. Even though it worked, it introduced a lot of restrictions
especially with tooling such as IDE, Arquillian, Embedded container, etc.

Thus, we  started migrating the entire TomEE codebase to the new jakarta namespace
and 9.0.0 is the result of this work.

We fully pass the entire TCK for the Jakarta EE 9.1 Web Profile and - as a cherry on the cake - we decided to address a long time
request to support a newer version of MicroProfil. Thus, we are pleased to announce that TomEE 9.0.0 is fully MicroProfile 5.0 compliant.

In addition, we fixed a couple of bugs and did some dependency upgrades.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to this release, including all of our users and the people who submitted bug reports,
contributed code or documentation enhancements.
