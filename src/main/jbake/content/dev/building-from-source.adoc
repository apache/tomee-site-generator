== Building from source

=== Checking out the source

To checkout the source, run this command with your subversion client.

   svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/openejb/trunk/openejb-eclipse-plugin openejb-eclipse-plugin

=== Building the source

To build the plugin you will need Maven (the build has been tested with Maven 2.0.7).
To run the build, issue this command

   mvn -Dassemble clean install

You should be aware that this will download any dependencies, including a copy of Eclipse.
This will take a while for your first build.

=== Importing the plugin code into an Eclipse workspace

You can generate the Eclipse projects for the plugins by running the following command

   mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse

You can add the M2_REPO classpath variable to your Eclipse workspace by running the following command

   mvn -Declipse.workspace=<path-to-eclipse-workspace> eclipse:add-maven-repo
