Title: July2007
CURRENT FOCUS

Primary activities in the project are around polishing up features,
user-facing code, reducing dependencies, documentation, and taking care of
legal in preparation for the coming 3.0 release. No real issues stand in
the way at this point, builds and voting should start soon.

CONTRIBUTIONS

More wonderful documentation contributions have been made by contributor
Karan Malhi who is actively scraping our list archives and creating
documentation from old emails.

EXTERNAL INVOLVEMENT

Contributed managed connection support to commons-dbcp. This will eliminate
our custom database pooling code, and adds an important new feature to
DBCP. This feature should be useful to anyone using DBCP in a managed
environment such at Tomcat. Also, OpenEJB has a large set of data base test
case, and we have already found a few bugs to fix in DBCP for which we are
working on fixes.
