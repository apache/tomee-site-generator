 CURRENT FOCUS

Primary activities in the project are around polishing up features, user-facing code, reducing dependencies, documentation, and taking care of legal in preparation for the coming 3.0 release.
No real issues stand in the way at this point, builds and voting should start soon.

CONTRIBUTIONS

More wonderful documentation contributions have been made by contributor Karan Malhi who is actively scraping our list archives and creating documentation from old emails.

EXTERNAL INVOLVEMENT

Contributed managed connection support to commons-dbcp.
This will eliminate our custom database pooling code, and adds an important new feature to DBCP.
This feature should be useful to anyone using DBCP in a managed environment such at Tomcat.
Also, OpenEJB has a large set of data base test case, and we have already found a few bugs to fix in DBCP for which we are working on fixes.
