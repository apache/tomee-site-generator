Title: April2008
The highlight of early February was the release of OpenEJB 3.0 beta 2 which
was very well received and triggered another small increase in overall
users@openejb.a.o traffic.  We've also seen some encouraging growth signs
we haven't seen for quite a while: users answering each other's questions;
first time posters saying "we've added this feature, do you want it?"; more
questions answerable with documentation links; random new faces on IRC.

Work on OpenEJB 3.0 final began towards the end of February with the first
binaries up for vote on March 11th.  Some wonderful feedback on both the
dev and users list revealed some critical technical issues with those
binaries and the vote was cancelled so that the issues could be fixed. 
Several members of the community went the extra mile to help get issues
fixed and the release out the door.  After steady stream of bug fixes,
legal file maintenance, and a few more aborted votes, the long anticipated
OpenEJB 3.0 Final was released April 12th.  The binaries proposed a month
prior pale in comparison to the binaries eventually released and we are all
very pleased with the quality of the 3.0 final.  We are very excited to see
what kind of a splash 3.0 will make and expect a 3.0.1 will be required
soon.

The work contributor Jonathan Gallimore has been doing with an OpenEJB
Eclipse plugin has taken root with other developers in the community and
development naturally changed from code drops to frequent patches and
discussion.  A big thank you to committer Daniel Haischt for contributing
to the Eclipse plugin and giving Jonathan someone to work with and the
opportunity to demonstrate his collaborative skills.  A bigger thank you to
Jonathan for his patience.
