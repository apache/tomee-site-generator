Title: June2007
All Incubator Infrastructure has been migrated over to tomee.apache.org
as well as removal of any miscellaneous Incubator related disclaimers in
code and website.  

The project is excited to have implementation of EJB 3.0 complete and to
see our sister project, Geronimo, announced JavaEE 5 Certification. 
Community short term goals are a release of OpenEJB 3.0 along with regular
published snapshots.  Early development discussions are underway on
clustering, application validation as well as general items for code clean
up.  List activity post JavaEE 5 Certification is back up to normal.

We still gain more contribution interests from new people like *Karan
Malhi* who is interested in fixing some issues with OpenEJB 3.0 assembly
build process.
