Title: August2007
Work on the OpenEJB 3.0 release is coming to a close. Documentation remains
the largest outstanding item. A complete audit of all documentation was
completed and concrete steps to improve it were detailed.  Progress on
updating the out-of-date documentation has already been made.

The usability of the codebase has matured significantly through many
contributions from the community and very little remains to be completed in
that regard.

Developer activity is up. We are delighted to have voted in a dedicated
contributor, Karan Malhi, as a new committer and he has proudly excepted.
No CLA is on file yet.

User list activity overall remains low, though some new faces have started
to pop up whom we are hoping can provide us with some good pre-release
feedback.  We hoping to see a measurable increase in user list activity
post release.
