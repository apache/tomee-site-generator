All Incubator Infrastructure has been migrated over to tomee.apache.org as well as removal of any miscellaneous Incubator related disclaimers in code and website.

The project is excited to have implementation of EJB 3.0 complete and to see our sister project, Geronimo, announced JavaEE 5 Certification.
Community short term goals are a release of OpenEJB 3.0 along with regular published snapshots.
Early development discussions are underway on clustering, application validation as well as general items for code clean up.
List activity post JavaEE 5 Certification is back up to normal.

We still gain more contribution interests from new people like _Karan Malhi_ who is interested in fixing some issues with OpenEJB 3.0 assembly build process.
