Title: July2008
The OpenEJB 3.0 Final release in mid April brought some good attention to
the project and more new users.  User list traffic showed a small increase
in April and May and a sharp spike in June.  July looks to be a slow month
so far.  Many users are content and anxiously awaiting the next release.

Planning for the next release has begun.  The list of fixes and
improvements is growing very large.  If all goes well 3.1 it won't be too
much longer before we start spinning binaries for 3.1.	Major new features
will include more EJB 3.1 support, jaxb performance increases through the
SXC project, network performance increases in client/server communication,
cmp and jpa conversion improvements, tomcat console improvements, and fixes
in the jdbc connection pooling.

Jonathan Gallimore was voted in as a committer with great support. 
Jonathan is not just a new committer to OpenEJB but to the ASF.  A very
warm welcome to Jonathan!
