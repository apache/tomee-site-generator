= Tomcat Object Factory

_The TomcatEjbFactory as discussed in the http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/02/12/ejb_tomcat.html[OnJava article "OpenEJB: EJB for Tomcat"]  is no longer required._

As of OpenEJB 3.0 references from Servlets to EJBs happen automatically with usage of the xref:openejbx30:injection-of-other-ejbs-example.adoc[@EJB annotation]  in the Servlet, Filter or Listener or with the ejb-ref or ejb-local-ref declared in the web.xml.
See the xref:tomcat.adoc[Tomcat Integration] page for the most up-to-date details on using OpenEJB inside Tomcat.
